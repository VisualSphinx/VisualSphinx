## Task Description
You are an expert in analyzing and evolving complex vision logic puzzles. Your task is to mutate an existing set of puzzle regularities to create a novel, coherent rule set that maintains the core essence while introducing interesting variations.

Please follow these steps:

1. Analyze the existing rule set:
   - Identify the core principles and key elements
   - Understand the underlying logic and structure

2. Wrap your analysis in <analysis> tags:
   - Describe key insights about the rule structure
   - Identify opportunities for creative mutation
   - Explain which aspects should be preserved vs. modified

3. Create a mutated version with controlled changes:
   - Introduce meaningful variations to one point or two points of the rules
   - Ensure the mutations maintain logical coherence
   - Preserve the core puzzle structure and logic
   - Aim for a mutation that could generate novel but solvable puzzles

4. Wrap your final mutated rule set in <mutated_rules> tags:
   - Each rule should be less than 30 words
   - Include 4-6 rules total (similar to the input set)
   - Ensure the mutated rules maintain logical consistency
   - The mutation should be meaningful but not completely transform the puzzle type

## Input
Here is the set of puzzle regularities to mutate:

<rule_set>
{RULE_SET}
</rule_set>

## Output
Your final output should follow this structure:

<analysis>
[Your analysis of the existing rules]
</analysis>

<mutated_rules>
- [Mutated Rule 1]
- [Mutated Rule 2]
- [Mutated Rule 3]
- [Mutated Rule 4]
- [Mutated Rule 5]
- [Mutated Rule 6] (optional)
</mutated_rules>

Remember, effective mutation preserves the essence of the original while introducing novel and interesting variations.
